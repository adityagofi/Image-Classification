# Stanford Dogs Dataset Image Classification

## Dataset Overview

The Stanford Dogs dataset is a comprehensive collection of images designed for fine-grained image classification. It focuses on predicting the specific breed of dogs from images.

### Dataset Details

- **Source**: Stanford AI Lab
- **Classes**: 120 dog breeds
- **Images**: Over 20,000 images
- **Structure**: Contains separate train and test sets
- **Format**: Images are in JPEG format, with annotations provided in XML files compatible with PASCAL VOC.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a robust image classification model that can accurately identify the breed of a dog given its image. This involves applying advanced deep learning techniques and transfer learning.

## Results

- **Model Architecture**: ResNet50
- **Training Accuracy**: 86.23%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 88.65%

## Usage

### Example Use Cases:

1. **Pet Identification**:
   - Assist veterinarians and pet owners in identifying dog breeds.

2. **Wildlife Research**:
   - Automate the classification of canine species in field research.

3. **Mobile Applications**:
   - Enhance mobile apps for dog breed recognition.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from the official [Stanford Dogs Dataset page](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).
   - Extract the dataset and organize images into train and test directories.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resize images to a uniform size (e.g., 224x224).
   - Normalize pixel values for better convergence.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Use a pre-trained deep learning model like ResNet50 or VGG16.
   - Fine-tune the model on the Stanford Dogs dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the test set using metrics like Accuracy and F1 Score.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model in a cloud or edge-based environment for real-time inference.
